## Upvote Logic

Posts will display in order of upvotes. In order to keep things fresh the upvote value will be divided based on time that has passed since the idea was posted. If a post has 100 upvotes and was posted 1 week ago, 100 of those upvotes will count. If it was posted 2 weeks ago 90 will count. It will lose 10% a week until it no longer shows.

If a new element is added, the upvote sensativity starts over. Example: An idea was posted 2 weeks ago and got 100 upvotes. 90 of those count. If a design was added to it, that two weeks starts over. The idea and the design are both eligible for upvotes. The designs upvotes count independently for the design and again for the idea. The same holds true if someone develops it.
